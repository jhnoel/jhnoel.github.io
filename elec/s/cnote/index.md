I built the Parts Express C-note speaker kit ([link](https://www.parts-express.com/C-Note-MT-Bookshelf-Speaker-Kit-Pair-with-Knock-Down-Cabinets-300-7140)). Much has been written about these speakers, so I will only say that they seem more than adequate for sensible volume levels in small-to-medium sized rooms.
