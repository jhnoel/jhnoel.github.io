	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I live in Greer, SC with my lovely wife Kristen. We love to cook together when we have time on the weekends, and when we have the chance we both enjoy spending time in the mountains. </p>
	<p>Unsurprisingly, I have a distinct mechanical bent, so growing up riding and wrenching on a Yamaha YZ125 provided many good memories. I passed off that ride to my younger brother as I drove off to college in a modified 1990 Mazda Miata. My mechanical thrills largely consisted of troubleshooting the previous owner's incomplete turbocharger installation, and it was a masochistic effort that never resulted in a proper automobile.</p>
	<p>Nowadays I largely spend my hobby hours with pet projects in the machine shop, turning pens on the lathe or fabricating small parts for my car buddies.</p>
